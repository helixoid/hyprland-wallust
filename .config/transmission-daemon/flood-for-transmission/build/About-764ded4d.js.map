It's a\n  frontend web app that doesn't require any extra service running to communicate\n  with Transmission. Even though it's a work-in-progress, it's definitely good\n  enough to use.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Flood for Transmission is a clone of\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Flood-UI/flood\" target=\"_blank\">Flood</a>, which\n  is originally build for rTorrent. All design and feature credit goes out to\n  the creators of that. The code however is not a copy at all, it's been build\n  from the ground up to make it work with Transmission.\n</p>\n\n<Header text=\"Feedback\" />\n<p>\n  If you have a specific issue or bug, please file a\n  <a\n    href=\"https://github.com/johman10/flood-for-transmission/issues/new\"\n    target=\"_blank\">GitHub issue</a\n  >.
